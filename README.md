# ML-Based-Smart-Door-Security-System
Description:
This project presents a face recognition system using Raspberry Pi for implementing a smart door lock system, including a Proteus simulation for testing and validation. The system offers a secure and convenient method for access control by utilizing facial recognition technology.

The architecture consists of a Raspberry Pi board equipped with a camera module and facial recognition software. The camera captures live video feed, and the facial recognition software processes the images to identify and verify the identity of individuals.

Upon successful recognition, the system triggers the unlocking mechanism of the door, allowing authorized individuals to gain access. In cases where the face is not recognized or the individual is unauthorized, the system denies entry and may activate an alarm or send notifications to designated personnel.

To validate the systemâ€™s functionality and performance, a Proteus simulation is developed. The simulation emulates the camera feed, facial recognition algorithm, and door lock mechanism, allowing for comprehensive testing under various scenarios and environmental conditions.

The simulation enables the evaluation of parameters such as facial recognition accuracy, response time, and system reliability. It assists in identifying potential challenges and optimizing the system design before its actual implementation.
